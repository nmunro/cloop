# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    container: nmunro/sbcl-quicklisp

    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
